# new-P5.js-responsive-project-template
This project offers a P5.js template that binds the canvas to a parent div and resizes it responsively whenever needed

I'll be using this as my default "new project" template if responsivness is needed

See: http://otacon.sk/newProjectTemplate/ and try resizing the window

Supports aspect ratios or full DIV size adaptation
